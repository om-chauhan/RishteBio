# RishteBio - Professional Bio-Data Builder (Detailed Context)

## Comprehensive Overview
RishteBio is a state-of-the-art web application designed to simplify the creation of matrimonial and professional bio-data. By combining elegant UI design with Google's Gemini AI, it provides users with a seamless way to represent themselves professionally and traditionally.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Frontend Architecture
The application is built using **React 19** and **Vite**. It follows a modular structure where pages and components are separated for maintainability.
- **State Management**: Primary application state for the bio-data form is managed within the `Editor` page and synchronized across various tab components.
- **Type Safety**: Extensively uses TypeScript (`types.ts`) to ensure data consistency across the form and templates.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with a dedicated `MobileBottomBar` and responsive templates.

### 2. Features & Modules

#### Bio-Data Editor (`/pages/Editor`)
- **Personal Information**: Basic details like name, height, religion, and caste.
- **Family Background**: Detailed family tree and occupation info.
- **Education & Career**: Professional background, income, and educational milestones.
- **Contact Details**: Multiple ways to reach the user.
- **Draft Recovery**: Uses local storage via `DraftRecoveryModal` to prevent data loss.

#### Template Engine (`components/BioTemplates.tsx`)
- Contains multiple predefined templates.
- Templates are rendered dynamically based on user selection.
- High emphasis on typography and layout (using CSS Flexbox/Grid).

#### AI Engine
- Uses `@google/genai` to connect to **Google Gemini**.
- Prompts are designed to take user inputs and transform them into poetic or professional bio-data descriptions.

### 3. Key Components
- `NavBar.tsx`: Responsive navigation with theme-aware styling.
- `CustomDatePicker.tsx`: A premium date-of-birth selector.
- `TemplateGalleryModal.tsx`: Visual selection interface for bio-data designs.
- `BioTemplates.tsx`: The core rendering engine for the final output.

## Code Conventions
- **Functional Components**: All UI is built using React Functional Components and Hooks.
- **Atomic Components**: Reusable pieces like `ToolbarButton` and `FormElements` are used to maintain consistency.
- **CSS-in-JS/Tailwind**: Styling is handled through a mix of utility classes and structured CSS.

## File Map
- `/App.tsx`: Main entry point and router configuration.
- `/pages/Home`: Landing page with feature highlights.
- `/pages/Editor`: The main workspace for users.
- `/components/BioTemplates.tsx`: Template definitions.
- `/translations.ts`: Centralized text for internationalization or theme content.

## Deployment & Development
- **Build**: `npm run build` generates a performant production bundle via Vite.
- **Environment**: Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` for AI features.
- **Assets**: Optimized SVG icons (Lucide) and modern image formats (WebP).
